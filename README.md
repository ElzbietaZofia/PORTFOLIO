## About me

I am a QA tester with experience in both manual and automated testing. I have worked with web applications in a commercial setting and have created test plans, test scenarios, and executed those tests. My fields of experience include writing tests in Playwright using TypeScript. I hold the ISTQB Foundation Level (FL) Certification obtained in 2022.

Testing is a job which gives me great pleasure and satisfaction. What is more, I am very interested in Test Management and Agile methodology. In my current job, in addition to testing, I also manage the backlog by maintaining a prioritized list of tasks for the development team to work on. Furthermore, I have experience in management as the former owner of an Interior Design Studio, where I managed the company and coordinated and monitored the work of contractors and suppliers. 

In addition to my software testing skills, I have experience as a WordPress webmaster/webdesigner and as a SEO specialist. 

In this portfolio I would like to share some of my projects.
