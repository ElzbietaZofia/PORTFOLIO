## About me

I am software QA tester with commercial experience in manual and automated testing and in managing the backlog by maintaining a prioritized list of tasks for teams of software developers and testers. My expertise includes writing tests in Playwright using TypeScript. I hold the ISTQB Certification.

In addition to my software testing skills, I have experience as WordPress webmaster, webdesigner and SEO specialist.
