## About me


I am a QA tester with experience in both manual and automated testing. I have worked with web applications in a commercial setting and have created test plans, test scenarios, and executed those tests. My fields of experience include writing tests in Playwright using TypeScript. I hold the ISTQB Foundation Level (FL) Certification obtained in 2022.

Testing is a job which gives me great pleasure and satisfaction. That is why I am very interested in Test Management and Agile methodology.

In addition to my software testing skills, I have experience as a WordPress webmaster/webdesigner and as an SEO specialist. Furthermore, I am experienced in management as the former owner of an Interior Design Studio, where I managed the company and coordinated and monitored the work of contractors and suppliers.

In this portfolio I would like to share some of my projects.
